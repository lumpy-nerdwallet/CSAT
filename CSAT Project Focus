CSAT Project Focus:

1) Spellcheck (how necessary is it? Use a basic tool):
	- needs a good NW-focused corpus: we can start by downloading all our texts, and maybe adding a dictionary of words and other texts

2) Sentiment Analyzer (put to the back)

3) Word Cloud - Topic Analyzer
	- NEEDS A CORPUS
	- Approach 1: TF-IDF (just something simple. Really, you just need to showcase those that are important)
	- Approach 2: LDA
	-
