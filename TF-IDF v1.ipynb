    "2. ~~\"No\", \"not\" should be added into the permissible lists, and glued to the word after stop-word-filtering. This better captures the \"no thanks\" situation.~~ *fix done Friday 220716* \n",
    "    1. Problem with that is that there are many junk messages that only say \"No\". I personally think of those as real junk and rather unhelpful for content, so I'm inclined to just throw them away. *fix done Friday 220716. New approach only considers not + NON-STOP real word, so the \"no\"s are rightfully ignored* \n",
    "3. How do we deal with new keywords? In this case what's important for content writers is the specificity of many proper nouns (for example, 'Costco' - points them to the exact card). *current problem: pick out good keywords within top comments*\n",
    "4. ~~Does a piss-poor job of dealing with anything other than comments of praise. I'm vaguely seeing one that goes \"help me apply for credit cards\" and a general complaint one, but those are vague.~~ *fix attempted Monday 250716. Simple answer: doesn't matter since all that isn't good is bad, and we can just mine keywords after that.*\n",
    "5. I need to think of a better way of dealing with comments that have multiple attributions. Currently the two approaches have their drawbacks:\n",
    "    1. The \"classify to max\" approach presumes only one topic per comment\n",
    "    2. The \"classify above a certain threshold\" approach is heavily contingent on the length of message - more words, higher thresholds."

      "Message 1: For my use this card is terrible.  Any card that claims to be an \"anywhere\" card and charges a rip-off 3% foreign exchange fee is being deceitful and dishonest.  Additionally, in this transfer I am going to experience a credit score drop because the limit on this card is $6,800 less than on my AMEX CostCo card which it replaces.  I will be voicing this loudly to CostCo and to Citi. There may even be a litigious angle to this situation.\n",

No, I won't give up my AMEX.  I HATE VISA!.  As a business owner, they soak you when you process payments.  As a consumer, they spend a fortune on prime time advertising, sports affiliations and exclusive deals, which means someone is paying and it is every consumer who pays more for goods and services because the costs get passed down.
