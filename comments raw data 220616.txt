Thus, receiving a credit limit so high that you&#039;ll not be using 25%-30% would actually harm one&#039;s credit score.

It is probably a confluence of factors when added together has created this phenomena. Asset consumption is a big part but I would note that at the tech bubble burst of 2000 a lot of companies got religion about cost cutting, off-shoring, contracting, automating and the Clinton Administration was leaving office ushering in the Bush tax and spending cuts. Those cuts reduced investment in infrastructure, R&amp;D and education. Effects we feel even more today. Debt is a huge problem in the form of student debt that will be a drag on the economy for decades if it doesn&#039;t precipitate a spending collapse sooner.\n"~"108.43.250.187"~"0"~"2016-05-13"

It seemed a bit high in today&#039;s market (no origination fees for private loans generally, are you assuming deferral during 4 years of inschool period?). Also do you have more detail on how does the ISA is affected by graduate school? Do the additional years in school not count since no payments are due, or do you get to count your $0 payments in those years against the term of your loan (sort of like $0 payments in IDR)? If those years count as payment years, then it seems as though no one would give a doctor an ISR loan because they spend so long in school."~"63.138.248.98"~"0"~"2016-05-24"

With so many depending on social security in retirement, the loss of a third to a half of income at the death of the spouse--there has to be a plan for income replacement.  Also, an asset that exists out of the market and can be utilized for planned withdrawals when the market is down, improves overall portfolio performance.  Finally, in the current market, with anticipation of rising interest rates, are these advisors recommending bond and bond funds?  And fairly accounting for fees, loads and taxes--some permanent life insurance products will outperform those recommendations.  These are some of the reasons why I&#039;m integrating solid permanent life insurance into my client&#039;s portfolio."~"209.64.152.62"~"0"~"2016-05-27"

One interesting thing on the info graphic is that men in the higher income range seem to do more chores than man in the low income range for each activity included. Wondering if you explored this any further? Intuitively, it makes sense that women who earn more spend less time on chores, and I would expect a similar trend for men to (since more income allows more activities to be outsourced). However, the data seems to indicate the higher income men do more housework than lower income men, which is interesting. Is the income range household income or individual income? If it is household income, maybe in households with two earners men contribute more to the household work? Maybe low income groups are more likely to have traditional gender role assumptions?"~"199.46.199.231"~"0"~"2016-06-02"

I&#039;m fed up with overpaying and open to new companies for pricing and coverage. I purchased a gently used 2014 Malibu LTZ in March. Today, I completed  an online StateFarm Quote and for the same coverage as Geico, they beat the rate by over $200 for the 6 month period. I am waiting for an agent to contact me now.

There are many assumptions implicitly built into his analysis that will introduce error.  The assumption of an annual 3% raise is an example.  Unless you are a government employee it is impossible to forecast your final salary many years out.  The entire assumption of basing your retirement needs on your salary is deeply flawed.  In order to create substantial net worth you need to live on a fraction of your income.  This fraction will vary widely as you try to project your necessary net worth and how much you need to tighten your belt to achieve that future net worth.  The 4% rule is still the best guidance available.  Everyone&#039;s primary focus should be on increasing their net worth.  It is very simple for investors to look at their net worth each year, multiply by 4% and ask themselves if they are on track to a comfortable retirement."~"198.74.176.100"~"0"~"2016-06-03"

"159539"~"195008"~"0"~"1"~"no"~"You fail to mention about grate customer service other than the grate prices that the other prepaid cellular company has. Some companies say that they are a better company, but lie to you and tell you something that you already know or don&#039;t want to hear. Half the time like Boost Mobile (who runs on the Sprint network), Strate Talk, TracFone Wireless (who are both affiliated companies) and other cellular companies don&#039;t have someone who cannot speak English very well. Half the time they will &quot;yes&quot; you to death or give you false information. If you ask for a supervisor sometime they cannot speak English as well (Boost Mobile is like that) and the Representatives will give you a &quot;song-and-a-dance&quot; and questions you on why you want a supervisor! In short, it&#039;s a catch 22 when you call in to these so-called &quot;cellular companies.&quot; So if your in doubt, ask the customer (the consumer) themselves."~"66.87.117.34"~"0"~"2016-06-07"

Wells Fargo acted like I was attempting to get over on them. The phone service was unreal - rude, wouldn&#039;t slow down to answer my questions then hung up on me.
