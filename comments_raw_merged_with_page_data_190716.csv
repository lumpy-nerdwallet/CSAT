One interesting thing on the info graphic is that men in the higher income range seem to do more chores than man in the low income range for each activity included. Wondering if you explored this any further? Intuitively, it makes sense that women who earn more spend less time on chores, and I would expect a similar trend for men to (since more income allows more activities to be outsourced). However, the data seems to indicate the higher income men do more housework than lower income men, which is interesting. Is the income range household income or individual income? If it is household income, maybe in households with two earners men contribute more to the household work? Maybe low income groups are more likely to have traditional gender role assumptions?","199.46.199.231",0,2016-06-02

It seemed a bit high in today&#039;s market (no origination fees for private loans generally, are you assuming deferral during 4 years of inschool period?). Also do you have more detail on how does the ISA is affected by graduate school? Do the additional years in school not count since no payments are due, or do you get to count your $0 payments in those years against the term of your loan (sort of like $0 payments in IDR)? If those years count as payment years, then it seems as though no one would give a doctor an ISR loan because they spend so long in school.","63.138.248.98",0,2016-05-24

Also, an asset that exists out of the market and can be utilized for planned withdrawals when the market is down, improves overall portfolio performance.  Finally, in the current market, with anticipation of rising interest rates, are these advisors recommending bond and bond funds?  And fairly accounting for fees, loads and taxes--some permanent life insurance products will outperform those recommendations.

At the end of the day, Dave Rowan can do these overly complex calculations and be no closer to the answer.  There are many assumptions implicitly built into his analysis that will introduce error.  The assumption of an annual 3% raise is an example.  Unless you are a government employee it is impossible to forecast your final salary many years out.  The entire assumption of basing your retirement needs on your salary is deeply flawed.  In order to create substantial net worth you need to live on a fraction of your income.  This fraction will vary widely as you try to project your necessary net worth and how much you need to tighten your belt to achieve that future net worth.  The 4% rule is still the best guidance available.  Everyone&#039;s primary focus should be on increasing their net worth.  It is very simple for investors to look at their net worth each year, multiply by 4% and ask themselves if they are on track to a comfortable retirement.","198.74.176.100",0,2016-06-03
